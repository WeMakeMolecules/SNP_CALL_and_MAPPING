#SNP plotter                                                                                                    
a simple script that extracts all the SNPS from a set of VCF files and creates a two-column table              
column 1 is the base coordinate and column 2 is the total number of SNPs for that base in the set of VCF files 
just run it in a folder with the VCF files and provide the gene number:                                        
 e. g. perl SNP_PLOTTER.pl g999                                                                                
outputs are 4 files, each has a table, all snps, and codons 1,2 and 3
